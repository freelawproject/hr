## Overview
At Free Law Project, we use an HRA (health reimbursement arrangement) to provide insurance. Our HRA is administered through [Take Command]. This pre-tax benefit allows you to select a healthcare plan on your state marketplace, and be reimbursed for individual premiums (and additional approved medical expenses, like dental or vision insurance) on your paycheck before taxes.


## Eligibility
All full time US employees are eligible to receive this benefit, and are strongly encouraged to take advantage of it.


## Benefit
Free Law Project has set an allowance for reimbursement for your state, and you will be reimbursed up to this allowance each month on your first paycheck of the month. Your reimbursement comes the month after your first premium. For example, in Feburary, you are reimbursed for January's costs. The allowance is unique to your state, and covers the montly premium of the median gold-tier plan in your area. For example, if the monthly premium in your area for the median gold plan is $500, you have a $500 allowance. If you choose to enroll in a lower cost plan, like a top silver tier plan with a $400/month premium then the additional $100 in your allowance can be used for dental, vision, or additional approved medical expenses. And if you select a more expensive plan, like a platinum-tier plan for $700/month then you cover the additional $200 cost for your premium above the allowance amount. This benefit only covers marketplace plans. You can shop for your plan using the Take Command platform. If you already have a marketplace plan that you're happy with, you can submit your proof of coverage on the Take Command platform to have your premiums reimbursed. The only thing to be aware of is that you cannot utilize any marketplace tax credits if you are using an HRA. You'll need to get those removed before you submit your proof of coverage. You can read more about [proof of coverage requirements] on the Take Command platform.

## Q&A

Q: Why don't we do a standard group plan?
A: Because we have a small number of employees spread over so many different states, it's extremely difficult for us to find a plan that will cover everyone. Reimbursing individual premiums is the best solution we have to make sure you can get health insurance in your state that meets your needs.

Q: Can my partner and/or children be covered by the HRA?
A: Free Law Project covers 100% of employee premiums and 75% of partner's and dependents' premiums. When registering on Take Command, you'll be able to see your updated allowance amounts after inputting this information.

Q: I don't want to use this, I'm on my partner or parent's plan.
A: You can waive the benefit in the Take Command portal

Q: I don't know which plan to select.
A: Take Command offers enrollment specialists who will help you select a plan that meets your needs. You can [schedule a call with an enrollment specialist here].

Q: I want to change my plan!
A: You can only change your plan during [Open Enrollment] (which happens at the end of the year) UNLESS you have entered a [Special Enrollment Period].

Q: I have another question that isn't covered here.
A: Ask Libby
